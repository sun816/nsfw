# nsfw

This is a fork of [Axosoft/nsfw](https://github.com/Axosoft/nsfw), with the only change that it allows passing a custom path for the native node module instead of shipping it with the package itself.

ZEIT uses this system in [Now CLI](https://github.com/zeit/now-cli) for powering the `now dev` command.
